## Basic thoughts

When creating the language, I really liked the look of
redirefting values like sometimes in C++.
This inspired me to design a new and unique
language syntax, I called hoverfly.

But with small to none experience of parsing syntax trees,
it fast became clear to me to be an impossible task.
That said I decided to start with easy syntax
and move onward until I create a perfeft language.
In theory.

In practice, I created a very easy abstract syntax,
but I liked it. That's why there is yet only one
version of hoverfly, and yet an esoteric one.
